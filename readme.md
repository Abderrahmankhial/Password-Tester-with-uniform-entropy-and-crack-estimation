This code is a password strength tester that analyzes a given password based on various criteria. It checks for the presence of different character types (digits, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters), calculates the uniform entropy of the password, rates its strength, estimates the time it would take to crack the password using brute-force methods, and provides suggestions for improving the password strength.
